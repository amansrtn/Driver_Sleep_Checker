The Driver-Snoozing-System is a machine learning system designed to detect when a driver is falling asleep at the wheel and alert them before an accident occurs. The system uses the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file, which contains data about the location of 68 facial landmarks on a person's face, to analyze the driver's face and determine if they are exhibiting signs of drowsiness.
# Driver_Sleep_Checker
In this Repo we will be checking whether a Driver is "AWAKE","DROWSY" or "Sleeping". This will use 68-landmarks to check the state of the driver activeness.
